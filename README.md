# Python scripts to scientific work
## This repository contains python scripts I am using during my master's degree.

Mainly it is focused on few calculations and automations to plot a beautiful graph to my LaTeX dissertation (which I'm also doing the version control in another private git repository)

There is another [repository](https://github.com/gabriellnuness/matlabcodes) for my MATLAB scripts with much more content.

## Why?
I started using python because in the laboratory I work not every computer can run the newer versions of MATLAB without letting you in a bad mood. 
Also, to replace automations of instruments control that were previously built in LabVIEW.
Because python is way more versatile, allowing me to control the instruments via GPIB, collect the data and create vectorized plots to my final work. There is no need to use multiple expensive programs.

## Content
matplotlib
pandas
numpy
pyvisa

### NOTE: The scripts are in ongoing development.
